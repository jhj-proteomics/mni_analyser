mni_analyser calculates Minimum Number of Invidividuals (MNI) based on a set of zooarchaeological data.

Secondary to calculating MNI, the purpose of mni_analyser is to automatically identify bone elements in a zooarchaeological assemblage likely to be from a single, unique individual. This is paramount when performing biomolecular analyses as we want to avoid sampling the same individual twice.
